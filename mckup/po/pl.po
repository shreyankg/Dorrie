msgid "One thing to remember when you run a spin off of a CD or DVD is that as you use the system, any additional applications you install will not be there when you reboot your computer - there isn't any way to work around this because you cannot write out to bootable CD or DVD media. Additionally, any files you save will be lost when you reboot because Fedora runs off of the media, it doesn't access your hard drive.. When using CD or DVD bootable spins, you should always make sure you save your files to an external device such as a USB key or USB hard drive.
